# aoc-cli

This project was built to make it easy to grab the AOC prompt and input file. It was also built to make it easy to setup your projects for the AOC. I wanted an easy way to switch the language I was using during AOC that would set up some base files that includes tests.

## Current Languages Supported
If there is a language that is not supported that you would like to exist, please create a issue!
